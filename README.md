# FibVer - Rust edition

```This is just a dumb project, that should definitely not be used for anything serious```

It is a basic implementation of [FibVer]

Usage is `fibver <command> <input>` where command is one of `major`, `minor`, `patch` or `verify` and input is either a version number in the format `major.minor.patch` or `-` to read from stdin
